## Overview

It took about less than an hour to finish this whole project.
During the time, I got interrupted by my friend sometime ha..ha...But,anyway, I also checked the dev tools to see how my design project will look on different devices. It appers really well at the center on small devices, but in the large devices, there is still some margin area at the bottom. I thought it would take me about 2 hours to finish this project, I did it in less than 1 hr and I think this is not bad. I will be trying my best to complete the project as quickly as possible within the targed time.

## My process

Firstly, I look at carfully to the project and find solutions. For example,
"How can I center it?"
"Do I need to use flexbox?"
"Can there be any utility classes?"
"Which classes should I create?
After I have got some ideas, I straigntly jumped into how to structure my webpage with HTML. 
Thinking about how many section,header or paragraph will be included.
After finishing my basic html page, I jumped into CSS to style my basic page to look more beautiful.
Before stared styling it,
I checked the style guide line to check the font colors, sizes or font family.
Then, I stated styling my basic page.
When I finined my project, I carefully checked about the margin, padding and line-height as well.
Then, I felt somewhat satisfied with the way my final result looks. 
That is my process for this project.
Oh, I forget to add favicon and now I added it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- google-fonts


### What I learned

I can see that I can use flexbox much better than before. And, I also believe that my skills will be sharpened if I continue building projects from frontendmentor.io. Looking forward to gain many knowledge and experiences from my journey at frontendmentor.io.

### Continued development

As I have mentiond above, there is a problem when my design is showing on larger screens. It's not in the center vertically.

## Useful resources
w3schools - to add the favicon.
I have no idea of how to add it. Then, I got solution from that website.
